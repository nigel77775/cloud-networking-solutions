# REGIONAL LB ROUTE EXTENSION FOR BODY-BASED ROUTING
# ==============================================================================
#
# This file implements Body-Based Routing using LbRouteExtension with the
# regional internal Application Load Balancer.
#
# Key difference from LbTrafficExtension:
# - Route extensions run BEFORE URL map routing decisions
# - Route extensions can request body processing via ext_proc mode_override
# - Headers injected by route extension ext_proc affect routing
#
# Architecture based on GKE Inference Gateway body-based routing:
# https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/configure-body-based-routing
#
# Flow:
# 1. Request arrives at regional internal ALB
# 2. LbRouteExtension invokes ext_proc with REQUEST_HEADERS event
# 3. ext_proc uses mode_override to request REQUEST_BODY
# 4. ext_proc extracts model from JSON body, injects X-Gateway-Model-Name header
# 5. URL map evaluates routing rules with the injected header
# 6. Request is routed to appropriate backend (GKE, Vertex AI, etc.)
