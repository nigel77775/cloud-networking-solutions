# BODY-BASED ROUTING (BBR) EXT_PROC SERVICE
# ==============================================================================
#
# This file composes with the service-extension module to deploy the BBR
# ext_proc gRPC service on Cloud Run. The BBR service:
# 1. Receives request headers and body from the load balancer
# 2. Extracts the 'model' parameter from the JSON request body
# 3. Injects X-Gateway-Model-Name header for routing decisions
#
# ==============================================================================
