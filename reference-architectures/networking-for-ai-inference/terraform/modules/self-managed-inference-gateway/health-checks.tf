# HEALTH CHECK RESOURCES
# ==============================================================================
#
# Health checks are now created dynamically in backends.tf for backends
# that specify a health_check configuration. This file is kept for reference
# and for any global health check needs.
#
# Backend-specific health checks are defined as:
#   google_compute_region_health_check.backends["backend-name"]
#
# Backends that don't need health checks (Internet NEG, Serverless NEG):
#   - Set health_check = null in the backend configuration
#
# ==============================================================================

# Note: All regional health checks are now created in backends.tf using
# the flexible for_each pattern based on var.backends.services configuration.
