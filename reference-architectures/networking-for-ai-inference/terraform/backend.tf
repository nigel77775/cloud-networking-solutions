# Backend Configuration
#
# This uses partial backend configuration. Initialize with:
#   terraform init -backend-config="bucket=YOUR_GCS_BUCKET" -backend-config="prefix=YOUR_STATE_PREFIX"
#
# Or create a backend.conf file with:
#   bucket = "your-terraform-state-bucket"
#   prefix = "inference-gateway/terraform"
#
# Then run:
#   terraform init -backend-config=backend.conf
#
# Example backend.conf:
#   bucket = "my-project-terraform-state"
#   prefix = "inference-gateway/prod"
